In addition to this, the number of thefts when a high number was scanned - for example, if 15 were scanned and 3 stole I would estimate that one in every 5 stole, so for 20 visitors 4 would steal. So even if it is common that visitors from this planet would steal, its likely a smaller number would steal than for example, a planet with 15 visitors scanned and there being 10 thefts, although visitors from both planets are likely to steal the latter are more likely to have a higher volume of thefts.",3.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,60ec7fd3b0fa07a7fbdb25d6,12_counter,exp3_12to12_1,3
